    <p>In the 90s, <span class="bein">Hong Kong films</span> were famous: Kungfu films were exceedingly popular in the western market, while comedies and romantic films were the highlights in the market in mainland China. At that time, Hong Kong was the leader of Asian economy. Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan became superstars because of the popularity of HK films. Even today, quite a few fans still miss the days various HK stars showing at the stage of films. People still cherish the memory of Bruce Lee, missing his unique understanding of Kungfu, missing his philosophy of martial arts. Even Mike Tyson said:” <em>Bruce Lee had an awesome philosophy about life: you hurt your man, do as much damage as you can and then you get out.</em>” His “Be Water” theory is also famous:</p>
    <p><em>“Empty your mind. Be formless, shapeless, like water. Now you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow, or it can crash! Be water, my friend!”</em>

<p>While Kungfu films got a huge success in western market, other types of Hong Kong films also swept China. For example, In the Mood for Love makes thousands of girls have a dream to have a cheongsam, which is a traditional cloth for Chinese women. It’s known as expressing the women’s bodyline.</p>

<p>Chinese swordplay films make thousands of boys dream of becoming swordsmen. And Stephen Chow has been regarded as Hong Kong’s King of Comedy because he has appeared in more than 50 films and won numerous Hong Kong Film Awards.</p>

<p>One explanation for people’s constant memory of past Hong Kong films is that they don’t watch Hong Kong films now. In the 90s, the Hong Kong film industry produced over 200 films per year, compared to less than 50 today. Back to today, even the HK people don’t enjoy native films anymore, let alone western audiences. If we compared the top 10 box office films in 1992 and in 2018 in Hong Kong, you will find a supervising fact: the top 10 films in 1992 are all made in Hong Kong. In 2018, 8 of the top 10 films were made in America; most of them are also superhero films. The last 2 are Korean films.</p>

<p>What happened to Hong Kong films? Why are they not popular anymore?</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <h2>Reason 1: The Death of Bruce Lee</h2>
        <p>From the line chart, we could clearly notice there is a significant decline in the line of “Number of Countries importing HK films” after 1981, which is 90. That’s also the year the last film that Bruce Lee showed, the Game of Death 2. With his death, people’s interest in Kungfu seems to decrease a lot. A movie called Action 2, which is a brilliant Kungfu film, was published in 1983 lead by Jackie Chan. This movie reverted the decline of the export of Kungfu films to the world. However, their hard work still can’t stop the decline.</p>

<div class="container">
  <h2>Reason 2: Hong Kong film industries can’t create great visual effect films</h2>
  <p>If we compare the genres of the top 10 films in 1992 and 2018 in Hong Kong, we notice a change in people's tastes in movies. People used to like “action”, “comedy”, “drama”. But they are now big fans of “sci-fi”, “fantasy”. The key point behind “sci-fi”, “fantasy” is the science in movies.
  </p>
  <img src="gif/1.png" class="simg" alt="">
  <p>The visual effect technology ranges from motion capture film techniques, the science of perspective in chase scenes, state-of-the-art cameras, and the creation 3D worlds. People’s requirements for the science of movies become more and more strict. Seven of the top 10 films in 2018 are 3D films. And they all have IMAX versions. People have gotten tired of traditional films. They want fantasy, innovative, exciting films.</p>
  <img src="gif/2.png" class="simg" alt="">
  <p>And the Hong Kong film industry can’t do that. On the one hand, they cannot create films with advanced technology. If we compare the intellectual property proportion in Hong Kong, Singapore, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States, China used to be the last, but has since caught up and surpassed the other countries. Hong Kong has fallen to last place. That means Hong Kong lacks the core competitiveness of technology development, to some extent.</p>
  <img src="gif/3.png" class="simg" alt="">
  <p>If you don’t think this chart directly related to the lack of technology development in Hong Kong, we can see another chart:</p>
  <img src="gif/4.png" class="simg" alt="">
  <p>It’s clear that the rich love investing in real estate in Hong Kong according to Forbes. Actually, 24 of 50 rich people’s wealth originates from real estate investment in HK. Nearly half of the wealth is focused around real estate in Hong Kong.</p>
  <p>Things are totally different in China and America. We are very familiar with Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Alibaba, Huawei. Some people’s wealth originated from their unique technology of making smartphone screens, or building social media platforms.  But in HK, technology has no chance to get developed, because businessmen were not interested in high technology investment. However, since technology is the core competitiveness for everywhere. Resulting from their decisions, HK business lacks the core competitiveness, even if Hong Kong is the economic center of Asia (In recent years it has gradually been replaced by Shanghai and Shenzhen). Hong Kong’s technology can’t support people to create a trusted brand. That causes the fragility of Hong Kong’s economy.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Reason 3: The vulnerable economy in Hong Kong makes people reluctant to invest and consume films</h2>
  <p>Because it relies on other countries’ economies, Hong Kong is sensitive to the crises. In this way, the rich are also sensitive to the vulnerable economy.</p>
  <img src="gif/5.png" class="simg" alt="">
  <p>Films are expensive investment items.  Many film budgets range from $100 – $150 million. For fic firms, it’s more expensive. Take The Avengers Infinity War for an example. With an estimated budget in the range of $316–400 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made. People are too nervous to invest expensive, high-risk items. They like to invest water, electricity, gas, oil, real estate and so forth. Four rich families monopolize life’s essentials in Hong Kong that hurt people’s life, causing high living costs, huge income inequality. People could only buy a 22m2 house with 1 million dollars in Hong Kong. They can’t afford that, so they have to live in a “coffin room”. Furthermore, theater ticket is expensive because of high rent and limited numbers of theaters. Because the receipts of the theater is less than the malls and apartments, the number of theaters is becoming less and less. Opening theaters more like to screen superhero films compared with native films, due to the pressure of monthly statement. In this case, consuming movies is not an easy thing.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In the end of this article, you know why Hong Kong film is not popular anymore. In Hong Kong, they have a word “zap sang”, which means that even in the worst wrecks, Hong Kong people still try their best to win a chance of survival. They work very hard. They did do a great job. But did they win? Will the protest win and then get what they really want? Maybe you don’t need my answer. You have a conclusion in your mind.</p>

  <!-- <p>Luckily, some wealthy Chinese people learned to develop technology from western countries and build new factories in China. They took advantage of the period of the First World War, when western countries defended their own countries and had no time to go forward, to develop Chinese light industry. The wealthy Chinese people are also the main powers to support students in the May 4th Movement. So, there is a significant increase in the exports after 1920.

  <h2>Today's Indigo Hand Making</h2>
        <p>Some people still insist on traditional ways to produce indigo fabric in southeast China nowadays. In my hometown Guizhou, Miao people are famous for this traditional craft. If you go to local landscapes, there will be some indigo fabric handicrafts sold. Many of them express good wishes.
        </p>
        <p>For example, a big splash, the carp has leaped through the dragon's gate, means success, especially for students who have passed their exams.</p>

<p>In spite of traditional design, some artists also tried many ways to innovate indigo fabric to promote traditional things that got more use in modern society.

  <h2>Indigo after 1949</h2>
    <p>Maybe some people think the indigo fabric would quickly revive with the establishment after the war of the People's Republic of China in 1949 period. But it’s not true. China took a roundabout course in economic development in the Great Leap Forward, which moved too quickly and created economic problems. A significant result of the Great Leap Forward was a drastic decline in food output, which caused tens of millions of deaths in the Great Chinese Famine. Approximately 30 million people died in only five years. After that, the Cultural Revolution, which established to recorrect the problems of the Great Leap Forward, but damaged China's economy further. We can almost say, China had enough calamitous trouble in their modern history.
    </p>
    <p>But their fortunes began to change with the coming of the 1980s. <strong>The Chinese Economic Reform</strong> changed the case that the Chinese market was closed for nearly 30 years, most Chinese lived on less than $2 per day. The Reform pushes the high-speed development of the Chinese economy. From 1978 until 2013, rapid growth occurred, with the economy increasing by average 9.5% a year. How did they do that?
    </p>

  <p>First of all, the government gave up some control of social resources, ignited entrepreneurship, gave private firms considerable freedom.
  </p>
  <p>Secondly, the government opened its market at some <strong>Special Economic Zone</strong> in Guangdong and Xiamen, to attract overseas investment. These areas have more flexible policies, tariff reduction and exemption, and ideal investment environment.
  </p>
  <p>Thirdly, China actively became a member of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization. Mayor Zhu Rongji used to say:” We have been talked, on and off, for 15 years (join to WTO), even hair from black to white”. Why China spared no effort to officially join WTO? Being a member, China can collaborate with other member countries without any extra tariffs or other barriers. If any trade friction happens, WTO will help to solve it.
  </p>
  <p>With their help and diligent Chinese who were pressed for so long time, China is world-shaking changed.

    <!-- <h2>Export</h2> -->
    <!-- <p>We can compare the top 5 categories of exports from China and America to the world in 1960 and 2018. In 1960, the top one exports community is vegetable products. Product rank from 1 to 3 is rice, which is No.1 item, worth 33057089 in the list, then soybeans, tea.
    </p>
    <p>But in 2018, the top one community is the machine. Product rank from 1 to 3 are telephones, computers, integrated circuits. It is no surprise that China is the so-called “the factory of the world” with rapid industrialization.</p>
    <p>Even if the second community in 1962 and 2018 both are textiles, the detailed product names are different. In 1962, the exports of Chinese textile is mainly composed of woven cotton, house linens, raw silk and so on. In 2018, the exports of Chinese textile consists of knit sweaters, non-knit men and women’s suits, non-knit men and women’s coats. You can see, Chinese factories mainly produce finished products now, away from cheap mass production.

    <h2>Denim Imports from China to USA</h2>
      <p>With the fast reviving manufacturing industry of China in the 1990s, factories began to produce the indigo synthesis, denim fabric, silk in China, especially in Guangdong, a Special Economic Zone.
      </p>
      <p>Nowadays, 70% indigo synthesis and denim fabric in the world come from China. Take the city Xintang for an example. It is known as "hometown of Chinese Jeans", which has over 2600 jeans-making and relative enterprises, producing 2.5 million denim. It occupies 30% of the exports of Chinese denim, sold abroad like Russia, America, Europe and so forth.

      <br>
      <br>
      <p>As for the imports of jeans from China to America, you will find California imports most. Through research, I found that Levi's owns more than 100 factories in China. Their products will be shipped to San Francisco. Some will be sold to the native. As you know, the population of California is huge. The number of jeans consumers is also huge. Besides, California is also the economic center. Denim fabric will be processed, then to the global market.

    <h2>New challenge for Chinese Indigo</h2>
      <p>Some Chinese factories are in the transition from low-cost manufacturing to knowledge-based industries. Their products are good. But nobody knows that. They have to rely on international big enterprises to survive. How to create their own brand is the biggest challenge for them. Another challenge is water pollution. chemical reagent hurts workers’ health. The government stopped 76 firms’ production last year. One reason is to improve the polluted environment. Another reason is to facilitate new product projects, like the “Foxconn” core supporting business.
      </p>
      <p>All in all, indigo mirrored the decline and revival of China. The dye, which is used for your jeans, is also used for ancient Chinese cloth. And if you check your jeans, it might tell you:” I’m made in China:)”
